# Cursor Automation Setup

Use this prompt for a Cursor Cloud scheduled automation only if you prefer Cursor Cloud to perform the maintenance step instead of the GitHub workflow's built-in Claude Code action.

By default, `.github/workflows/config-discovery.yml` acts as the sensor, runs the config-maintenance agent, commits changes, and opens or updates the PR. This file is an optional fallback for teams that want the scanner and the agent runner separated.

## Recommended Trigger

- Schedule: daily, after `.github/workflows/config-discovery.yml` has run.
- Repository: this repo.
- Branch: default branch, unless your automation service creates a working branch automatically.

## Prompt

```text
You are maintaining AI-Secure-Configs.

Goal: keep hardened AI tool configs current across Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Codex CLI, Codex Desktop, Continue.dev, Windsurf, Tabnine, Amazon Q Developer, Gemini CLI, Google Gemini, Claude Desktop, OpenAI Platform, and Claude API.

Process:

1. Check for an open config maintenance PR or branch named automation/config-maintenance.
2. Read automation/config-discovery/reports/latest-config-discovery.md.
3. For each changed upstream source, open the upstream source and identify real admin, managed-settings, permission, privacy, sandbox, network, MCP, audit, retention, identity, or content-exclusion controls.
4. Pay special attention to "Potential config terms not found in local tool files."
5. If a real control changed or was added, update the affected tool's tier files, rationale docs, README, rollout guide, deployment paths, validation steps, and workflow-preservation notes.
6. Keep deployable JSON valid. If comments are needed, update JSONC and companion .comments.md files.
7. Do not add secrets, tokens, org IDs, team IDs, tenant IDs, or production hostnames.
8. Do not create a report-only PR. The PR should contain actual config changes when a relevant control changed.
9. If no config change is needed, update the report with a short "No config update needed" explanation for each changed source.
10. Validate edited JSON, YAML, TOML, and shell files using AGENTS.md.
11. Commit and push the branch.

Use automation/config-discovery/agent-prompt.md as the detailed policy for how to write config updates.
```

## Expected Result

For a vendor change such as Claude Code adding dynamic workflows, the agent should:

- Add the new managed setting to the Claude Code tier files.
- Set secure values by tier, for example Baseline allows local experimentation, Moderate and Strict disable the research-preview workflow mode.
- Update JSONC, deployable JSON, rationale docs, tier delta tables, and workflow-preservation notes.
- Push a PR that reviewers can merge as an actual config update.

## When To Use Cursor Automation

Use this approach when your GitHub Actions environment cannot access the required model API secret, or when you want a human to review the discovery branch before the maintenance agent edits config files.
