# Cursor Automation Setup

Use this prompt for a Cursor Cloud scheduled automation if you want the end result to be a PR with real config updates, not only a discovery report.

GitHub Actions acts as the sensor. Cursor Cloud acts as the config-maintenance agent.

## Recommended Trigger

- Schedule: daily, after `.github/workflows/config-discovery.yml` has run.
- Repository: this repo.
- Branch: `automation/config-maintenance` when it exists, otherwise the default branch.
- Run condition: there is an open config-maintenance PR, or `automation/config-discovery/reports/latest-config-discovery.md` changed since the last run.

## Prompt

```text
You are maintaining AI-Secure-Configs.

Goal: keep hardened AI tool configs current across Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Codex CLI, Codex Desktop, Continue.dev, Windsurf, Tabnine, Amazon Q Developer, Gemini CLI, Google Gemini, Claude Desktop, OpenAI Platform, and Claude API.

Process:

1. Check for an open config maintenance PR or branch named automation/config-maintenance.
2. Read automation/config-discovery/reports/latest-config-discovery.md.
3. For each changed upstream source, open the upstream source and identify real admin, managed-settings, permission, privacy, sandbox, network, MCP, audit, retention, identity, or content-exclusion controls.
4. Pay special attention to "Potential config terms not found in local tool files."
5. If a real control changed or was added, update the affected tool's tier files, rationale docs, README, rollout guide, deployment paths, validation steps, and workflow-preservation notes.
6. Keep deployable JSON valid. If comments are needed, update JSONC and companion .comments.md files.
7. Do not add secrets, tokens, org IDs, team IDs, tenant IDs, or production hostnames.
8. Do not create a report-only PR. The PR should contain actual config changes when a relevant control changed.
9. If no config change is needed, update the report with a short "No config update needed" explanation for each changed source.
10. Validate edited JSON, YAML, TOML, and shell files with `python3 scripts/validate_config_files.py` and the targeted AGENTS.md commands for edited files.
11. Commit and push the branch.

Use automation/config-discovery/agent-prompt.md as the detailed policy for how to write config updates.
```

## Expected Result

For a vendor change such as Claude Code adding dynamic workflows, the agent should:

- Add the new managed setting to the Claude Code tier files.
- Set secure values by tier, for example Baseline allows local experimentation, Moderate and Strict disable the research-preview workflow mode.
- Update JSONC, deployable JSON, rationale docs, tier delta tables, and workflow-preservation notes.
- Push a PR that reviewers can merge as an actual config update.

## Why This Requires Cursor Automation

The GitHub workflow is intentionally dependency-free and does not call a model API. It can detect source changes and identify candidate config terms, but it cannot safely decide the tier policy for a brand-new vendor control. That security decision needs an AI maintenance agent or a human reviewer.

If the GitHub workflow has repository secret `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, it can run the Claude Code action before opening the PR. If the secret is absent, the workflow opens a discovery PR and this Cursor automation should complete the review and config edits.
